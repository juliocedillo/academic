My name is Julio Cedillo and I’m a third-year transfer student majoring in sociology and a prospective PhD student. I currently lead the Latinx Sociological Association at UC Berkeley alongside fellow undergraduate Latinx sociologists. I am highly interested in social inequity, economic sociology, medical sociology, technology and AI, surveillance, and Latinx sociology.

Before Berkeley, I studied at San Diego City College where I earned three associate degrees in Sociology, Chicanx Studies, and Social & Behavioral Sciences. My associate theses focused on hyperconsumerism and unionization present in 2020 Starbucks stores, medical assimilation among low-income diabetics, and policing and redefining masculinity in college fraternities.

I currently sit in the Raíces Retention and Recruitment Center’s Transfer Committee dedicated to enhancing transfer students’ experience at UC Berkeley and mentoring community college applicants through the UC process. I am the second one in my family to attend a university. I am forever indebted to those who played and continue to play a role in getting to where I am now.
