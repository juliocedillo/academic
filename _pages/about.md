My name is Julio Cedillo and I'm a fourth-year undergraduate in the Department of Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. I'm a prospective PhD student hoping to focus on theoretical, economic, political, and anticolonial sociology. Before Berkeley, I studied at San Diego City College, earning three associate degrees in Sociology, Chicana/o Studies, and Social & Behavioral Science. My associate theses investigated the impacts of hyperconsumerism and surveillance among Starbucks stores, medical assimilation among low-income diabetics, and the policing and redefinition of masculinity in college fraternities.
