My name is Julio Cedillo. I’m a fourth-year transfer student majoring in sociology and a prospective PhD student. I currently lead the Latinx Sociology Association at UC Berkeley alongside fellow coordinators majoring in the social sciences. I hold two fellowships at Berkeley: researching _panlatinidad_ at the George A. Miller Scholars Program and assisting Associate Professor Armando Lara-Millán in economic sociological research within the Latinx Research Center's Faculty-Mentored Undergraduate Research Fellowship

Before Berkeley, I studied at San Diego City College, earning three associate degrees in Sociology, Chicana/o Studies, and Social & Behavioral Sciences. My associate theses investigated the impacts of corporate surveillance, customer expectations, and emotional labor during unionizations in Starbucks stores, medical assimilation among low-income diabetics, and policing and redefining masculinity in college fraternities.

I have two ongoing research projects. The first examines the relationship between military service and political engagement among Latino men. Specifically, the study examines how Latino men use their military service to legitimize their citizenship, seeking to overcome their marginalized identity and facilitate their assimilation into American society. The second examines how gay men build trust with other users on geospatial apps designed for casual encounters. The study focuses on how gay men craft their digital identities and adopt specific vocabulary to facilitate successful meet-ups. It also explores how their communication skills with anonymous profiles help mitigate risks and increase the likelihood of in-person connections. Ultimately, this research aims to explore aspects of social interaction and relationship-building that are not easily addressed in real-life settings.
